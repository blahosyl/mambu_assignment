# API documentation auditing/editing task for Mambu

## Trial task

As part of my hiring process for [Mambu](https://mambu.com/), a SaaS cloud banking platform, I performed an audit of their [Tasks API documentation](https://api.mambu.com/#mambu-api-v2-loan-products). 
The resulting editing changes and points of clarification can be found in this repository.

### Task

> "Take the API definition for the Tasks API and (using the information in our user guide) add a general description
as well as more informative descriptions for each endpoint.  
The goal of the task is that a reader should not have to switch between the API 
and user docs to understand what Tasks are in Mambu and how to work with and manipulate them."

### Format

- Changes were to be added to the existing Swagger file

### Sources

- [Tasks API Definition](https://demotenant.dev.mambucloud.com/api/swagger/json/tasks_v2_swagger.json)
- [End-user API Docs](https://api.mambu.com/#mambu-api-v2-tasks), [Doc2](https://demotenant.dev.mambucloud.com/apidocs/#Tasks)
- [User Guide Section](https://support.mambu.com/docs/communicating-with-other-users)


### Tools used

since I left the company.
